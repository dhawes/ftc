- specific turn task, don't rely on getHeading()
- look at while comparisions.  is != part tripping us up?
- use breakpoints, write more data to the NXT
- add wait in turn functions. maybe this is going too fast?
- give task all CPU 
- problem is almost certainly in the while loop of the turn code. the turn seems
  to start briefly. why does it stop?
